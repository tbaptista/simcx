Simulator for Complex Systems. Developed for the course in Complex Systems from
the Department of Informatics Engineering of the University of Coimbra. This
software is still in beta stage. Tutorials and documentation are available, but
are still in development (check link above).

Note that due to its main purpose (education), most of the code is written with
a focus on readability, rather than performance.
